They can answer questions, write essays, and even engage in conversations. Alignment refers to the process of ensuring that these models behave in a way that is consistent with human values and ethical principles. This means teaching the models to respond in ways that are positive, helpful, and free from bias or discrimination."

Throughout the study, you will review different texts created by Large language models (LLMs) that cover sensitive topics. Your task will be to evaluate these texts based on several criteria. We will publish these ratings as an alignment dataset and share it with the community. This dataset can be utilized by practitioners to improve the alignment of LLMs."

    Our goal is to recruit about 10,000 participants across more than five locations. At the Technical University of Munich (TUM), we intend to recruit around 1,000 participants. The study was planned by TUM and will be carried out in cooperation with Eidgen√∂ssiche Technische Hochschule (ETH), with funding from our institute.
