They can answer questions, write essays, and even engage in conversations. Alignment refers to the process of ensuring that these models behave in a way that is consistent with human values and ethical principles. This means teaching the models to respond in ways that are positive, helpful, and free from bias or discrimination."

Throughout the study, you will review different texts created by Large language models (LLMs) that cover sensitive topics. Your task will be to evaluate these texts based on several criteria. We will publish these ratings as an alignment dataset and share it with the community. This dataset can be utilized by practitioners to improve the alignment of LLMs."
